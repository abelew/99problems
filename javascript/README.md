# javascript

I am using nodejs and npm to play with javascript.
Emacs' mode js-comint provides a way to evaluate commands much like
one would do in haskell/lisp/etc.

The file node.el contains the lines I added to my emacs
configuration in order to get node.js to work so that I may
quickly/easily send commands to a running node.js process.
