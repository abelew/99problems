# Problem 01

In our lab we do everything via R markdown and pandoc.
I see no reason to deviate from that for this.

To see the result of the evaluation, hop into the block and hit
control-c control-c.

```{r report, eval=FALSE}

## If for some reason you want a pdf report of this document:
render("01.rmd", output_format="pdf_document")

```

```{r problem01}

start_list = c(1,2,3,4,5,6)

get_last = function(lst=c(1,2,3,4,5)) {
    answer = NULL
    if (is.null(lst)) {
        return(answer)
    } else {
        for (c in 1:length(lst)) {
            answer = lst[[c]]
        }
        return(answer)
    }
}

print("The original list was: ")
as.character(start_list)
print(paste0("The last element is ", get_last(start_list)))

```
