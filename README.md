# 99problems

Playing with the 99 problems in a few languages.  The primary goal of
this is to remind myself how to program in some languages I haven't
played with in a long time.

## Ada

This is a highly structured language which I find difficult, but
elegant.
I am using the GNU Ada compiler: gnat-4.9.
(apt-get install gnat)

## Asm

I will not likely ever be coherent in asm.  For my attempts in using
it, I am using nasm in 32 bit mode.
(apt-get install nasm)

## bash

The bourne again shell is a surprisingly complex language of its own.
It has arrays, hashes, everything but pointers...
(apt-get install bash)

## C

For C code, I intend to make use of glib from the GTK project.  It
provides nicely curated data structures and documentation.
Like 99% of the world, I will be using gcc.
(apt-get install gcc)

## C#

I have always been fairly dismissive of C#, but I am super curious
about it.
(apt-get install mono-utils)

## C++

I have never been what I would call a good C programmer, but C++
_kills_ me.  I am thinking to use boost for some of this, as it seems
to be pretty consistent and good.
(apt-get install libboost-all-dev libboost-doc)

## cobol

The common buisness-oriented language (completely obsolete buisness
language).  I have attempted a few times to write simple stuff in this
to no avail thus far.
(apt-get install open-cobol)

## coffeescript

A small language which compiles into javascript.
(apt-get install coffeescript)

## eiffel

I dunno anything about eiffel.

## forth

My only exposure to forth is through the Sun microsystems openboot
prom from stop-A.
(apt-get install gforth)

## fortran

Fortran is (to me) a curious way of thinking, but fast as all hell.
(apt-get install gfortran gfortran-doc)

## gcl

Gnu common lisp is one of _many_ surviving dialects of lisp.  It is a
reasonably 'modern' dialect with easy access to things like the
system's environment.
(apt-get install gcl cltl)  ## cltl is a book on common lisp

## go

Go is a new google C-like language.  It looks pretty.  I am intrigued
that the go compiler is also a go interpreter.
(apt-get install golang)

## haskell

Haskell is so very nerdy, and also such a pita to properly install.
(apt-get install ghc cabal)

## java

I will admit to being a non-fan of java, but apparently more recent
iterations have made it less obnoxiously verbose, and the openjdk
environment is apparently quite good now.
(apt-get install openjdk-8-jre openjdk-8-jdk openjdk-8-doc)

## javascript

It appears that this is no longer a stupid toy for making obnoxious
web browser toys.  It also now has a bizarrely diverse set of
environments.
(apt-get install bsh node-cli npm)

## lua

What an odd scripting language
(apt-get install lua5.3)

## m4

I used to write sendmail hacks in this!
(apt-get install m4)

## ml

MetaLanguage, we learned a little of this when I was an undergrad, it
is weird.
(apt-get install ocaml)

## Objective C

I know absolutely nothing about objective C except that it apparently
is used on macs now a lot.
(apt-get install gobjc)

## Octave

Octave is a MatLab compatible language from the free software
foundation (or at least they start with GNU).
(apt-get install octave)

## pascal

Pascal is neat, but I have only had momentary exposure to it.
(apt-get install fpc)

## perl

The first language I became 'fluent' in.
(apt-get install perl)

## php

I've made fun of php forever, but evidently in recent years it isn't
quite so horrible...
(apt-get install php5-cli)

## prolog

Prolog is fascinating and difficult.
(apt-get install gprolog)

## python

Everyone loves python.  For this I am choosing to play with python 3.
(apt-get install python)

## R

We use R almost exclusively in our lab.
(apt-get install r-base)

## ruby

Ruby is pretty.
(apt-get install ruby1.9)

## rust

Rust is a mystery to me
(apt-get install rust)

## sbcl

This is another common lisp implementation.
(apt-get install sbcl)

## scala

I've never actually used scala.
(apt-get install scala)

## scheme

A super-small subset of lisp, there are a lot of scheme interpreters
now...
(apt-get install guile-2.0 scsh scm)

## smalltalk

Another language I've never used.
(apt-get install smalltalk)

## sql

Probably not appropriate for these tasks.
(apt-get install sqlite mariadb-client mariadb-server)

## tcl/tk

TCL and tk provided the first real multi-platform windowing toolkits.
(apt-get install tcl tk wish)
