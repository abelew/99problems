# 99problems

Playing with the 99 problems in a few languages.  The primary goal of
this is to remind myself how to program in some languages I haven't
played with in a long time.

## Ada

This is a highly structured language which I find difficult, but
elegant.
I am using the GNU Ada compiler: gnat-4.9.

## Asm

I will not likely ever be coherent in asm.  For my attempts in using
it, I am using nasm.
