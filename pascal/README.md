# Pascal

I know little or nothing about pascal.  I found a tutorial on
'tutorialspoint.com' and learned the following in the first 30 seconds
or so:

* It was named for Blaise Pascal, a French mathematician.
* It is based on Algol, which I have also never learned; it turns out
even that some Algol is a derivitave of pascal.
* It was used on the Mac Lisa in the 80s
